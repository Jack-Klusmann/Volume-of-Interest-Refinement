# Volume of Interest Annotation in Augmented Reality

This project explores user-friendly methods for annotating 3D volumes of interest in industrial environments using Augmented Reality (AR).  
The application, built in Unity (C#), implements **voxel carving**: users take photos of an object from multiple angles and trace its outline, enabling the system to reconstruct a low-detail 3D model.  

Key features include:
- Smart cube adjustment for automatic object framing  
- Improved voxel carving workflow and UI updates  
- Cross-platform support (iOS, Android, Windows)  

A user study with 15 participants demonstrated that voxel carving is an effective and intuitive annotation method for maintaining **digital twins of industrial facilities**.
